START XAMPP, 
GO TO localhost/phpmyadmin TO CREATE A DATABASE NAMING "db_payroll_system" AND IMPORT THE SQL FILE TO RUN.
WITHOUT THE DATABASE THE PROJECT WON'T RUN.
You should be able to see all the tables and data after importing the sql file.

NOTE: DATABASE FILE IS INSIDE "DATABASE (MySql)" FOLDER!



THANK YOU AND HAVE A GOOD DAY! :)
